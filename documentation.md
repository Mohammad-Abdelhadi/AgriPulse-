# AgriPulse: Project Features & Demo Guide

---

## 1. Key Project Features

AgriPulse is built on a foundation of trust and transparency, leveraging cutting-edge AI and distributed ledger technology.

-   **AI-Powered dMRV (Digital Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification):**
    Our platform uses Google's Gemini API to automate the farm verification process, making it accessible and affordable. The system operates on a multi-layered, score-based model with an approval threshold of 70/100:
    1.  **Rule-Based Scoring (70 points):** Initial checks evaluate data completeness, the number of sustainable practices adopted, and the economic logic of the farm's credit estimates.
    2.  **AI Certificate Analysis (30 points):** Gemini's multimodal capabilities are used to analyze the uploaded PDF ownership certificate, assessing its authenticity and extracting key data points to validate the farmer's claims.
    3.  **AI Plausibility Check (Penalty):** A final AI analysis of the farm's story, location, and practices ensures consistency. If the AI flags the submission as low-quality or nonsensical (e.g., spam), it applies a heavy penalty, guaranteeing rejection. This robust, automated process eliminates the high costs of traditional certification.

-   **Radical Transparency with Hedera Consensus Service (HCS):**
    Every verification decision—including the full score breakdown from the dMRV system—is recorded as an immutable message on the HCS. This creates a permanent, publicly auditable trail that anyone can check on an explorer like HashScan, directly solving the problem of "greenwashing" and building unparalleled trust.
    *   **Example Verification Log:** [`https://hashscan.io/testnet/transaction/0.0.7163581-1761886599-999888777`](https://hashscan.io/testnet/transaction/0.0.7163581-1761886599-999888777)

-   **Instant Settlement via Atomic Swaps:**
    AgriPulse leverages Hedera's native atomic swaps to handle transactions. When an investor buys credits, a single, cryptographically secure transaction occurs instantly: the investor's HBAR is transferred, funds are automatically split (95% to the farmer, 5% to the platform), and the corresponding carbon credit tokens are delivered to the investor. This is trustless and eliminates payment delays.
    *   **Example Atomic Swap:** [`https://hashscan.io/testnet/transaction/0.0.7130606-1761886707-794393576`](https://hashscan.io/testnet/transaction/0.0.7130606-1761886707-794393576)

-   **Verifiable NFT Certificates for a P2P Marketplace:**
    To enhance user engagement and provide tangible proof of impact, the platform mints unique on-chain NFTs for significant transactions. These are not just collectibles; they are **verifiable certificates of impact**. For investors, these NFT certificates represent their ownership of retired carbon credits and are designed to be the foundational asset for a **future peer-to-peer (P2P) secondary marketplace**, allowing them to trade credits with other investors. The artwork for each certificate is uniquely generated by Google's Gemini API, making each one a distinct record of a real-world climate action.

## 2. Demo Walkthrough

### **Step 0: User Registration**

While the demo provides pre-configured accounts for convenience, new users can easily register:
1.  Navigate to the **Get Started / Auth** page.
2.  Choose a role (**I'm a Company** for Investors, or **I'm a Farmer**).
3.  Click **Continue** and provide an email and password to create your account.

### **Demo Credentials**

For a guided experience, use these pre-configured accounts. All are connected to the Hedera Testnet.

-   **Admin:** `admin@admin.com` / `admin123`
-   **Farmer:** `farmer@farm.com` / `farmer123`
-   **Investor:** `inv@inv.com` / `investor123`

### **Step 1: Admin - Initialize the Platform**

1.  **Log In as Admin.**
2.  Navigate to the **Admin Dashboard**.
3.  Click **Initialize Platform** and confirm. This single action creates all required on-chain assets: the fungible carbon credit token, the three NFT collections, and the HCS topic for the audit trail.

**Outcome:** The marketplace infrastructure is now live on the Hedera Testnet. You can verify the created assets on HashScan using their unique IDs from the Admin Dashboard.
-   **HCS Audit Topic:** `https://hashscan.io/testnet/topic/0.0.7165849`
-   **Platform Token (JCO2):** `https://hashscan.io/testnet/token/0.0.7165850`
-   **Farm NFT Collection (APF):** `https://hashscan.io/testnet/token/0.0.7165851`
-   **Farmer NFT Collection (APL):** `https://hashscan.io/testnet/token/0.0.7165852`
-   **Investor NFT Collection (API):** `https://hashscan.io/testnet/token/0.0.7165853`

### **Step 2: Farmer - Create the Supply**

1.  **Log Out** and **Log In as Farmer.**
2.  Go to **My Farm** and complete the one-time **Step 1: Associate Wallet** setup.
3.  **Register a Valid Farm:**
    -   Click **Register New Farm**.
    -   Fill out the form with the following details for a valid submission:
        -   **Farm Name:** `Golden Grain Oasis`
        -   **Location:** `Al-Mafraq Governorate – North Eastern Region`
        -   **Land Area:** `45` (unit: `dunum`)
        -   **Agricultural Type:** `Wheat and Barley`
        -   **My Farm's Story:** `Nestled in the highlands of Al-Mafraq, this farm has passed through generations of growers dedicated to cereal production. Over time, new irrigation systems and soil health practices have transformed it into a model of sustainable dryland agriculture.`
        -   **Farm Ownership Certificate:** Upload the file `Jordan_Farm_Certificate_1.pdf`.
        -   **Carbon Reduction Practices:** Check the boxes for `No-till/Minimum tillage`, `Reduced chemical fertilizer`, and `Efficient irrigation`.
        -   **Price per Credit ($):** `0.80`
    -   Click **Submit for Verification**. The AI-dMRV will approve it, mint a unique Farm NFT, and list it on the marketplace.
4.  **Register an Invalid Farm:**
    -   Register another farm using junk data (e.g., Name: `Junk Farm`, Story: `aaaaaaaa...`).
    -   The AI will reject it for low plausibility, demonstrating the anti-spam and quality control feature.

**Outcome:** A verified, tokenized carbon credit supply is now available on the marketplace. The approval is permanently recorded and verifiable on-chain.
