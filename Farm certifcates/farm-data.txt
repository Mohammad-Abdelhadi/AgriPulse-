Over the past decade the owner replanted terraces, installed drip irrigation, and introduced native cover crops to rebuild soil life. The farm focuses on low-input olive production and works with local beekeepers to maintain pollinator habitat. Long-term goals include increasing organic matter, establishing a small agroforestry strip, and reducing fossil fuel use through solar pumps and more efficient transport. Community training days and seed-saving exchanges are part of the farm‚Äôs outreach to build a regional resilience network.
