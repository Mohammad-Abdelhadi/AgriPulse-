1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
----------------------------------------------------------------------

AgriPulse is a decentralized carbon credit marketplace on the Hedera network, specifically engineered to unlock Africa's vast, untapped potential in the Voluntary Carbon Market (VCM). Our mission is to empower millions of African smallholder farmers by providing direct access to global climate finance, while offering corporations a trusted, high-integrity source of verifiable carbon credits.

By integrating Google's Gemini AI for a revolutionary Digital Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (dMRV) process, we solve the market's deepest challenges: opacity, high costs, and a lack of trust. Our platform leverages Hedera's low-fee, high-throughput DLT to ensure radical transparency and instant settlement.

Our business model is lean and scalable, built on a 5% transaction commission that massively undercuts legacy intermediaries. For the DoraHacks Web3 Africa competition, AgriPulse presents not just a project, but a viable, profitable business poised to become the definitive gateway for African carbon credits, projecting a clear path to onboarding thousands of farmers and processing millions in transaction volume within three years.

2. THE AFRICAN OPPORTUNITY
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Africa is at the forefront of the climate crisis, yet it receives less than 3% of global climate finance. The continent's agricultural sector, dominated by over 33 million smallholder farms, represents a colossal, untapped resource for carbon sequestration. However, these farmers are systematically excluded from the VCM due to:

1.  **Prohibitive Costs:** Traditional certification can cost tens of thousands of dollars, an impossible sum for smallholders.
2.  **Complexity:** The manual, paper-based verification process is slow, bureaucratic, and inaccessible.
3.  **Exploitative Middlemen:** A chain of brokers and intermediaries siphons off the majority of the carbon credit's value, leaving farmers with a fraction of the revenue.
4.  **Lack of Trust:** Buyers are wary of African credits due to perceived risks in verification and monitoring, creating a "trust deficit" that suppresses prices.

**AgriPulse is the solution.** We are not just building a marketplace; we are building the trust layer for the African carbon market.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
3. OUR SOLUTION: TAILORED FOR AFRICA
----------------------------------------------------------------------

*   **AI-Powered dMRV:** Our system uses Google Gemini to instantly analyze farm data, satellite imagery inputs, and ownership documents. This automates verification, slashing costs from >$20,000 to near zero and making it accessible to every farmer.
*   **Radical Transparency with HCS:** Every verification result is immutably logged on the Hedera Consensus Service (HCS). This creates a "digital passport" for every credit, providing buyers with an unchangeable audit trail and eliminating greenwashing.
*   **Direct & Instant Payments:** Hedera Atomic Swaps ensure that when a corporation buys a credit, the payment is instantly split and sent directly to the farmer's digital wallet. No delays, no intermediaries, just fair value.
*   **Community & Ecosystem:** Our Phase 2 plan includes a Service Provider marketplace, creating a circular economy where farmers can use their carbon revenue to purchase seeds, equipment, and training from local businesses, fostering sustainable development.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
4. BUSINESS MODEL & REVENUE STREAMS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Our model is designed for rapid scale and profitability.

*   **Primary Revenue: 5% Transaction Commission:** We take a flat 5% commission on all primary and secondary market sales. This is a radical disruption of the 30-40% taken by traditional brokers, delivering 95% of the value directly to the farmer.
*   **Scalability:** By automating verification and settlement, our operational costs are minimal, allowing us to profitably serve a massive, long-tail market of smallholder farmers.
*   **Future Revenue:** Premium data analytics for corporate ESG reporting and a small commission on the future Service Provider marketplace.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
