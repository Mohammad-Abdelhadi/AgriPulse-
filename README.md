## Executive Summary

AgriPulse makes carbon markets transparent, secure, and accessible. We connect sustainable farmers with corporates and investors through Hederaâ€™s HCS + HTS and Google Gemini AI, ensuring direct impact and trust.

## The Problem

Carbon markets fail small farmers:
-   **No Trust:** Unverifiable credits and greenwashing.
-   **High Costs:** Intermediaries take big cuts.
-   **Complex Access:** Certification is costly.
-   **Slow Payments:** Delays hurt cash flow.

---

## The Solution

AgriPulse uses AI + Hedera DLT for transparency and efficiency:
-   **HCS Validation:** Immutable on-chain proof of dMRV data.
-   **HTS Payments:** Atomic swaps send 95% instantly to farmers.
-   **NFT Rewards:** AI-generated HCS NFTs boost engagement.
-   **Security:** Usersâ€™ private keys are securely stored locally, never on our servers.

---

## Core Features

-   **HTS Integration:** Uses Hedera Token Service (HTS) to manage carbon tokens and NFTs with secure, low-cost, and high-speed transactions.
-   **AI-Powered Verification (dMRV):** Google Gemini analyzes farm data for quality, preventing fraud and ensuring credit integrity.
-   **Radical Transparency:** Every verification is logged on the Hedera Consensus Service (HCS), creating a public, unchangeable audit trail.
-   **Instant & Fair Payments:** Hederaâ€™s Atomic Swaps enable direct, instant payments â€” farmers receive 95% of every sale.
-   **Engaging Rewards:** AI generates unique NFT certificates and badges for farmers and investors.

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 1: Foundational Enhancements & Core Features
-   **Backend & Database Integration:** Transition from local storage to a secure backend and database to manage user data, farm details, and NFT metadata, ensuring scalability and data integrity.
-   **Real Wallet Integration:** Implement support for browser extension wallets like HashPack using the Hedera WalletConnect standard, removing the need for users to handle private keys directly.
-   **Enhanced dMRV & Farm Registration:** Expand the farm registration form with more detailed fields (e.g., soil type, historical land use, water sources) to feed into an improved dMRV model for more accurate CO2e calculations.
-   **Comprehensive User Profiles:** Develop dedicated profile pages for farmers and investors. These pages will showcase a user's transaction history, a gallery of their earned NFTs, and role-specific information like a farmer's portfolio of farms or an investor's total retired credits.
-   **Marketplace V2 - Filtering & Search:** Upgrade the marketplace with advanced filtering (by location, crop type, price, etc.) and search functionality to improve discoverability for investors.

### Phase 2: Ecosystem Expansion & Liquidity
-   **Secondary Marketplace:** Launch a peer-to-peer (P2P) marketplace enabling investors to trade their liquid carbon credit tokens with each other. This will increase liquidity and create a more dynamic market.
-   **Verifiable Retirement Certificates:** Upon retiring credits, automatically generate a downloadable, shareable certificate (e.g., PDF) that includes transaction details and on-chain proof, providing formal documentation for ESG reporting.
-   **Service Provider Marketplace:** Introduce a new "Service Provider" user role, creating a marketplace where agricultural consultants and equipment suppliers can offer their services to farmers, fostering a circular economy within the platform.
-   **Governance & DAO:** Begin the development of a platform governance token. This will empower the community of farmers and investors to vote on key platform parameters like commission rates and feature development, progressively decentralizing control.
